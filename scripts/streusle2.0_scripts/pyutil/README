pyutil
======

This is a library of general-purpose Python modules/scripts that I have found useful, 
especially for text processing/natural language processing applications.

The scripts typically assume Python 2.7, while taking steps to simplify adaptation to
Python 3.x versions--for instance, use of the print() function with 
`from __future__ import print_function'.
